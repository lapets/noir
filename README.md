An artifact primarily of historical interest: a terminal editor conceived as an extremely compact, relatively portable, functional text editor for command line/terminal environments.

This was originally written in 2004 for recreational purposes in both C and Perl. Many functionalities usually available in editors are missing. The code was written to make the editor as portable as possible, and it can be adapted in a matter of minutes to use any other display library by modifying a handful of functions.
